Compile mastermind with:

```
git clone https://github.com/Heathcorp/Mastermind.git
cd Mastermind/compiler
cargo build --release
cd target/release
./mastermind --help
```

NOTE: i've not managed to get the local version of mastermind working. Maybe just use the website: https://mastermind.lostpixels.org ??
